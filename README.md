## Preparation

- Get a set of fun color markers
- Get some blank paper
- Purchase a set of cards per attendee

## 0:00 Introductions, goals, safe place

Welcome. I'm _____. < Tell a story about how you became excited about pair programming. > I love pairing. As your facitiatlor, I'm here to share some techniques that I have found useful. However, I'm not an expert. I'm still growing in my ability to pair.

Goals:
* We will be improving our skills of pairing by discussing interesting pairing experiences. 

Anti-goals:
* We will not be covering the pros and cons of pairing. This workshop assumes that you already know the benefits of pairing. 
* We are not here to practice pairing.
* We are not here to practice giving and receiving feedback.

## 0:05 Exercise 1 - Pair drawing


## 0:15 Debrief

* What was easy?
* What was hard?
* How much control did you have?
* How does this exercise relate to pairing?

## 0:20 Rotate pairs
  Discuss this hypothetical situation:   one developer is an expert Rails Developer and an expert in RubyMine while the other developer is learning Rails and is an expert in VIM. What tools do we use?

## 0:25 Debrief

- strategy: use the tool of the "novice."  That way everyone is learning. 

- journey metaphor: some ahead -> learn,  some behind -> mentor"

## 0:35 Rotate pairs

Discuss this hypothetical situation: one developer wants to get a story finished today, the other wants to learn

## 0:45 Debrief
- you might not realize you are this situation
- antipattern: plowing ahead
- assumption: empower the student to drive learning
- assumption: each person is valuable and contributes to the equation
assumption: lift vs drag. Is lift > drag ?
- strategy: allow "novice" to lead in the morning, when they are full, allow the other to lead for awhile

## 0:50 Rotate pairs
  Discuss this hypothetical situation: your partner just pissed you off 

I realize that this is an open ended question. I'll provide some structure for discussion soon.

## 1:00 Debrief
Like a novel, often the dynamic can have stages.

Part one is a growing tension as small issues start building. Then there can be an event. If the event is serious enough there might not have been a pre-lude. Then it's good to take care of yourself. Then we re-engage. Let's talk about techniques for each stage, one at a time. 

What has happened for you that leads to a serious conflict?
What happened for you during the conlict?

How did you take care of yourself?
- techniques for grounding (take a break, walking, meditation, talking to a friend)

How did you re-engage?
- techniques for re-engaging (bring-it up acknowledge it, when you...I make up...and I feel....)"

## 1:20 wrap-up

This workshop was originally created by Todd Sedano. Here's a deck of his Considerate Pair Programming Technique Cards. The cards are not a game. The cards are meant to be read through sequentenaially. Once a pair has read through the cards, they can try a card randomly.

## (Optional) Collect feedback

< I like collecting feedback. >

* What is something that you liked about the workshop?
* What would you change in the workshop?
* Would you recommend this presentation for another _______ office? Why?
